# My First Game Engine from Scratch

In this repo I will be working on my first game engine in C++. This will
mainly be for experimentation and learning. To begin with, I will be
familiarizing myself with the tools needed to build an engine, like libraries
for rendering to the screen. 

The *terminal* project is the one I am currently putting most of my attention toward.
The objective is to build a simple retro-style terminal and eventually incorporate
some rudimentary lexing so the user can interface with an "AI" to solve a little
mystery story. This would be sort of like a Choose-Your-Own Adventure type of thing.

My goal is to learn more about interpreting, writing GUIs, and working with low level
libraries.
