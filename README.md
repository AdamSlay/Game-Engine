# My First Game Engine from Scratch

In this repo I will be working on my first game engine in C++. This will
mainly be for experimentation and learning. To begin with, I will be
familiarizing myself with the tools needed to build an engine, like libraries
for rendering to the screen. The first file is pixel.cpp in which I am attempting
to print pixels to the screen using C++ and SDL.
